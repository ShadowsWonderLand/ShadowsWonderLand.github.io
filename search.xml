Hyperbole (夸张) The use of exaggerated terms for the purpose of emphasis or heightened effect. e.g.: When she heard the bad news, a river of tears poured out. Irony (讽刺) The use of words to convey the opposite of their literal meaning. e.g.: It would be a fine thing indeed not knowing what time it was in the morning.

Not all of the things included here will appear on the examination, but you need to be prepared just in case. Exam Format Section A – Mainly factual recall and understanding questions on key terms from this semester (35%) Section B – Multiple Choice (20%) Section C – Reading comprehension: extended writing (15%) Section D – Extended writing (30%) Critical Thinking – Possible Questions What is critical thinking? An effective, logical approach to academic work. It encourages students to reflect on what they learn. critical thinking is defined as: “the process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion Name four skills you associate with critical thinking. analysis questioning indepentent learning ​ applying How does critical thinking improve a person’s quality of reading (or writing, or both)? Encourages analysis and questioning of texts. Helps us detect bias, prejudice, inaccuracies, limitations or contradictions. Facilitates independent learning. How can critical thinking help students? Helps students distinguish between what is essential, what is possibly useful and what is probably irrelevant. The wording of the question and number of marks should act as a guide as to how much detail to include. Briefly Describe Three Elements of Critical Thinking It encourages individuals to analyse and ask questions rather than just accept things at face value. It helps individuals to identify bias or prejudice and to formulate arguments based on evidence. It helps individuals to understand the importance of historical and social context to topics studied. There are others. As this says ‘describe’ some detail is needed, but a 12 mark question requires much more. Features of Academic Writing Structure – introduction, body paragraphs (or main body), and conclusion. There should be a logical sequence. Purpose – can include inform, explain, compare and contrast, justify, analyse etc. Style – should be impersonal, objective, well-reasoned, and based upon carefully selected evidence. It includes careful analysis and critical thinking. Features of Academic Writing Possible Questions What should you include in an introduction? Some backgroud information and the thesis statement. What is a thesis statement? ​ A thesis statement usually appears near the end of the introductory paragraph of a paper, and it offers a concise summary of the main point or claim of the AW. Explain five different ways of supporting a point you are making in an academic essay. Using group of three Using statistics and data Using quotations Using examples Using questions, shock tactics Why are quotations useful in academic writing? It’s experts’ opinions and readers will believe what you are saying is true. Why do you include footnotes and a bibliography? To avoid plagiarism What should you include in a conclusion? a position or opinion or judgment reached after consideration Context Basically the what, where? when? who? how? and why? that readers need to know. Context helps the reader understand cultural, social, economic, political, philosophical and religious ideas. Some of the main things that affect context are time period, gender, race, religion, social, class, author’s purpose and bias etc. Context varies according to situation/type of writing etc. Example of Context Any academic essay you have written this semester: ​ Any work of literature, eg Romeo and Juliet The context might include what the task or question, what was being assessed (purpose), the number of words, the research you needed to do, the skills you were expected to demonstrate etc. What else? The author and the time it was written are very important (reflect contemporary attitudes); a play (tragedy); why it was written (intended to be performed rather than read); key themes explored etc. Bias A one-sided view or account of a situation.a partiality that prevents objective consideration of an issue or situation. Seeks to pass opinion of as fact; often unsupported or based on flawed/twisted logic. It may reveal the author’s preferences or prejudices. It may be deliberate or accidental, subtle or blatant, conscious or sub-conscious. Politicians use biased language to attack their rivals. Other examples? ​ trademen use bias language to sell goods. Bias You may need to define bias and/or identify different types of bias. You may encounter bias in a reading text. You may have to change a sentence to make it biased, or make a biased sentence more objective. You may have to write in a biased style. Perspective The writer’s perspective can be an important element of context, as can the reader’s. An individual’s perspective is shaped by the time period; their social class; their age and gender; family influence; political, religious, social and cultural issues etc. A person’s perspective might reveal their bias. A person’s perspective often helps us understand motive. Different Types of Language Subjective Personal Biased Emotive Judgmental Manipulative Extreme Objective Impersonal Unbiased Neutral Analytical Balanced Measured Which of these do you associate with academic writing? Anything else? Second group. Based upon carefully selected evidence. Plagiarism Possible Questions What is it? Plagiarism means copying work from another source such as textbook or an article online and presented as being your own work. It may be a few lines, a couple of paragraphs or a whole section. Why is it considered a problem in academic writing? It is a form of intellectual property theft in academic writing. It is cheating. Why is it so widespread? Because Students do not know enough about the importance of Academic writing and online resources are easily gained. How can plagiarism be avoided? (eg Explain two ways …..) Use quotation marks whenever quoting an exact phrase, sentence or short paragraph Make sure you acknowledged and cited all sources of borrowed ideas and materials. Is plagiarism always a bad thing? No,sometimes make reference to others‘ opinion can widen our horizon，but can’t totally use others’ opinion and represent it as our own. Language You should be able to identify and give examples of different types of figurative language. You should know the difference between a simile and a metaphor. You should be able to identify and use techniques like groups of three. ​ This solution is simple, easy and comprehensive You should understand the function of rhetorical questions. A rhetorical question can lay emphasis on some point being discussed, when no real answer is expected Part Three Read the text and the question carefully. Use quotations to support the arguments you put forward and make sure you link them to the question. Include critical thinking – do not just accept what you are told at face value. Is it honest, accurate, reliable, logical etc? Make sure you write enough. Check your writing at the end to avoid silly mistakes. Part Four Here you will have to argue something. It will not be something you have looked at in class. Try to put forward views in support of and against the issue or quotation, but come down on one side. Include as many references as you can to recent events, history, literature, personal experience etc as you can to support your arguments. Use appropriate language and structure. Follow instructions carefully. Vary your Vocabulary What is the relationship between capability and responsibility? the quality of being capable to do sth . – physically or intellectually or legally a duty to deal with or take care of sb/sth, so that you may be blamed if sth goes wrong This was the basis of a question in a recent writing competition. Write down as many different ways of expressing the ideas ‘capability’ and ‘responsibility’ as you can. Vary Your Vocabulary Capability Responsibility Ability Talent Skill(s) Knowledge Proficiency Qualifications Duty/duties Leadership Management Goals/objectives Experience Choose Different Ways of Expressing these Terms Inequality Wealth Happiness Success Intelligence Advantage Disadvantage Violence Integrity Communication Knowledge Ambition Power Poverty Progress Education Conflict Rivalry Identify, and if necessary, explain what you understand by key terms in the question. Context to Quotations If you are given a quotation by a particular author, scientist or other famous individual, that is an important part of the context. Why might he/she hold this view? Do you agree with it? Think of reasons for/against. If it is a historical figure, does his/her ‘wisdom’ still apply today? Is the quotation serious or not? Possible sources might include Shakespeare, Voltaire, Napoleon, Einstein, Confucius. Who else? Summing Up You will definitely need to know about these in the examination: Context Bias Perspective Plagiarism Critical Thinking]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[如何用blog发布文章的教程 1.写文章：在hexo所在目录下，打开terminal，在命令行输入：hexo new a a是文章标题，也可以加上双引号,如“a”_posts里看见多了一个a.md文件。因此我们也知道了，默认情况下，hexo为我们创建的是markdown文件。刷新页面（http://localhost:4000/）我们能看见新添一个名字叫a的文章，没有任何内容。而这个_posts文件夹，算是一个比较特殊的文件夹，因为它装着所有你发布出去的文章。 2.草稿箱上一步我们新建出来的，叫做post page。除了post page，我们还可以新建draft page，也就是草稿。很多时候我们需要先写成草稿，而暂时不发布出去。draft page就可以满足我们的要求，我们的网站上是看不到草稿文件的。在terminal输入hexo new draft b我们会在source下看见一个新的文件夹，_drafts，这个里面会装我们所有的草稿文件。那写好了的草稿，如何可以在不发布的情况下，预览一下文章在网站上的样子呢？hexo server –draft当然，你要先shut down原来开着那个server，才可以开启新的server。如此一来，我们就可以预览草稿文件啦 3: 发布草稿当你准备好了要发布草稿时:hexo publish b你会发现_drafts里的b.md不见了，跑到了_posts里面,也就说明你的草稿发布成功了。 4: normal page我目前还不知道该如何用中文称呼这类页面。我们可以把post和draft统称为blog pages，在这之外的一种就是normal pages， 类似一个网站上的“关于”，“了解我们”之类的页面。这类page要如何新建呢？hexo new page c和前两种不同，这个命令会在source文件夹内创建出c文件夹，与_posts，_drafts并列。文件夹里面有一个index.md文件。刷新页面，你会发现c并没有出现在页面内，那它在哪儿呢？在网址后面加上c/， 即http://localhost:4000/c/，就可以看到了。正因为c不是一个blog page，所以它也不会出现在blog列表中，而是要通过URL去access。Step 5: 一个小tip现在我们了解到page一共有三种，post，draft，normal。 page_layout.png那为什么一开始的时候我们用hexo new a就直接生成了post page呢？因为默认的设置。打开熟悉的_config.yml文件，找到default_layout: post这句表示默认的页面会新建成post格式的。所以，如果你习惯先把文章写成草稿，那就把它改成draft就好。]]></content>
